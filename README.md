# historic-trucks
historic trucks - released at nyd2018 - links some rastaconverter pics together and has a scroller at the last one

As said before, this was shown at nyd2018. Some people at atariage.com had interest in how you can
link together rastaconverter pics and have a timer for auto exit - here you go ;)

Last pic is with rmt music (by mk) and a little scroller.
